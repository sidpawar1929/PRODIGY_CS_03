**Implementation of Password Complexity Checker**

**Objective:**
Build a tool that assesses the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. 
Provide feedback to users on the password's strength.

**Procedure:**
This Python program checks the strength of a given password based on certain conditions. It defines a function password_checker that takes a password as input and evaluates its strength by checking its length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. The strength of the password is determined by counting the number of conditions it meets, and the program categorizes the password as "Strong," "Weak," or "Invalid" accordingly.
